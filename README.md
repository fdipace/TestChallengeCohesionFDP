# TestChallengeCohesionFDP

This project is intended to cover all 3 scenarios form the Cohesion test challenge for API.

Please once you clone this project, use Visual Studio to Run it.
Also, install the Nuget Package for RestSharp so you don't have any missing library problems.

Once that is done, make sure to compile the project so you can see the tests loaded and displayed on the Test Explorr window.
From there you can execute them one by one or the entire suite.

Note: The second scenario always fails due to a bug found with the pagination. Some of the Measurements IDs are displayed in both pages instead of being only in one.
